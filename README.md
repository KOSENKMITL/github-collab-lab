# GitHub Collaboration Lab (GitHub Classroom Ready)

This repository is used as a **starter template** for a GitHub Classroom assignment.

Students will practice:

- Basic Git & GitHub collaboration (fork, clone, branch, commit, pull request)
- Team workflow using Issues, Labels, Projects (Kanban)
- Basic automation using GitHub Actions and branch protections

## Lab Files

- `labs/01-basic-collaboration.md` — Basic collaboration workflow
- `labs/02-team-workflow.md` — Team workflow with Issues and Projects
- `labs/03-automation.md` — Automation with GitHub Actions and protected branches

## Practice Files

- `practice/students.md` — Students add their name via Pull Request
- `practice/conflict-file.txt` — File used to demonstrate and resolve merge conflicts

## GitHub Actions
